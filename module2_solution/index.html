					Why should I play this game of pretend?

				   I could curl up and hide in my room
				   There in my bed, still sobbing tomorrow
				   I could give in to all of the gloom
				   But tell me, tell me what for</p></div>

				   Why should I have a heavy heart?
				   Why should I start to break in pieces?
				   Why should I go and fall apart for you?</p></div>
